## First Event 
**#0 - The Castle**: Feb 6th, 2025 @ synvert xgeeks
Talk: Do Not Live in the Shadows (APIs) by Teresa Pereira (Cyber Threat Hunter @ Siemens Energy & OWASP Leiria Co-Organizer)

Abstract: This talk explores the concept of Shadow APIs, starting with a clear definition and their origins, and examines the multifaceted risks they introduce to software development. Through real-world examples, we will highlight the potential consequences of ignoring these “hidden doors” and discuss strategies for their identification, management, and mitigation. By the end of this session, you will gain actionable insights and strategies to reduce the risks posed by Shadow APIs and build more resilient, secure, and compliant systems.
