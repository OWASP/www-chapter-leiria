## History

The OWASP Leiria Chapter started its activities in January 2025.

## First Event 
**#0 - The Castle**: February 6th, 2025 @ synvert xgeeks

**Talk:** Do Not Live in the Shadows (APIs) by Teresa Pereira (Cyber Threat Hunter @ Siemens Energy & OWASP Leiria Co-Organizer)

**Abstract:** This talk explores the concept of Shadow APIs, starting with a clear definition and their origins, and examines the multifaceted risks they introduce to software development. Through real-world examples, we will highlight the potential consequences of ignoring these “hidden doors” and discuss strategies for their identification, management, and mitigation. By the end of this session, you will gain actionable insights and strategies to reduce the risks posed by Shadow APIs and build more resilient, secure, and compliant systems.

## Second Event
**#1 - Leiria Pine Forest**: April 10th, 2025 @ FNAC Auditório, LeiriaShopping

**Talk:** HTML Smuggling to EDR Bypass by Milton Araújo (Security Researcher @ Secure Tecnologia)

**Abstract:** Delve into how cybercriminals utilize HTML Smuggling to circumvent traditional security measures like Antivirus (AV) and Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions. This session will explore the nuances of this stealthy attack method, showcasing how malicious payloads can be discreetly delivered to target devices via browsers while evading standard security protocols.

## Last Event
**#3 - The Old Glass Factory**: September 19th, 2025 @ HLink offices (Marinha Grande)

**Talk 1:** Build Your Software Like a Fortress: Secure Configurations as Your First Line of Defense by Daniel Pinto (CTO & Senior Software Engineer @ Setwin)

**Abstract:** When building modern web applications and APIs, many developers focus on writing secure code — but overlook the crucial impact of deployment configurations. From authentication layers to RBAC, from HTTPS enforcement to header settings and firewall rules, misconfigurations remain one of the top causes of security breaches today.
In this talk, we’ll explore how simple configuration decisions can have a massive impact on your application’s security posture. We'll walk through real-world examples, common pitfalls, and practical strategies to harden your software during deployment — without introducing complexity or slowing down development.
Whether you're a developer or part of a DevSecOps team, you'll leave with actionable insights to help you build secure-by-default systems from the ground up.

**Talk 2:** AI-Driven Offense: Enhancing Every Phase of Web Testing by José Irio (Cybersecurity Consultant @ VisionWare)

**Abstract:** Artificial Intelligence is rapidly reshaping offensive security. In this talk, we’ll explore how AI can be practically applied to improve web application testing. We'll break down each phase of a typical assessment (reconnaissance, exploitation, and reporting) and highlight existing AI-powered tools developed by the security community. From automating tedious tasks to uncovering insights that might otherwise be missed, these tools demonstrate how AI can help testers improve both the efficiency and depth of web app security assessments.
