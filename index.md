## Welcome to OWASP Leiria!

The **Open Worldwide Application Security Project (OWASP)** is a global, non-profit initiative committed to improving the security of software. As part of this mission, the OWASP Leiria Chapter serves as a local hub for security enthusiasts, developers, and professionals to collaborate, learn, and contribute to making software and infrastructure more secure.

## What is OWASP?
OWASP provides free and open resources, including:
- Educational Content: Like the OWASP Top 10, a trusted guide to the most critical web application security risks.
- Open Source Tools: Such as OWASP ZAP, a powerful tool for finding vulnerabilities in web applications.
- Global Community: OWASP connects local chapters worldwide to foster learning and sharing.

## Our Vision for OWASP Leiria
Our chapter is dedicated to creating a vibrant and inclusive community in Leiria. Together, we aim to:
- Spread awareness about secure coding practices and application security.
- Facilitate workshops, hands-on sessions, and knowledge-sharing events.
- Empower participants to use OWASP tools and contribute to global projects.
- Foster collaboration among professionals, students, and enthusiasts interested in application security.
